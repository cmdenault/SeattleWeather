Some notes:

Convert the domain problem into a data problem
  ~ we want to describe the data (rather than predict)
  
 Engage with Ethical Considerations
  ~ Are we: moving toward equitable outcomes, respecting privacy and consent, avoiding bias in data sources, avoiding bias in algorithms and analysis?
  
 Also consider these
