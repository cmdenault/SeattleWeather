## Data Preparation
   To clean up the data (data_preparation.ipynb): <br>
      ~ converted necessary data types <br>
      ~ narrowed st louis data to just 2018-2022 and one weather station <br>
      ~ replace seattle's missing values with the mean across years of values on that day <br>
      ~ narrow to a data frame with precipitation data 2018-2022 for st louis and seattle: clean_seattle_stlouis_weather.csv <br> <br>

## Data Analysis
   Analyze the data in the notebook- data_analysis.ipynb -to form an answer to the project's question. To do this: <br>
      ~ broke up the main question into more specific sub-questions <br>
      ~ created new dataframes and graphs with the clean data related to the sub-questions <br>
      ~ come to a conclusion with all of the graphs made <br>

Some notes:

Convert the domain problem into a data problem <br>
  ~ we want to describe the data (rather than predict)
  
 Engage with Ethical Considerations <br>
  ~ Are we: moving toward equitable outcomes, respecting privacy and consent, avoiding bias in data sources, avoiding bias in algorithms and analysis?
  
 Also consider these <br>
